2.	Libraries required for Project. 
 
For a credit card fraud detection project using machine learning, you'll need several libraries depending on the specific tasks involved. Certainly! When working on a Credit Card Fraud Detection project using machine learning, youâ€™ll need to utilize several libraries and frameworks. Here are the essential ones: 
 
Python (3.x): Python is the primary programming language for implementing machine learning models and handling data manipulation. 
 
NumPy: NumPy is used for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
 
Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It's especially useful for handling structured data like CSV files, which might contain your transaction data. 
 
 
Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization. They help in understanding the data distribution, patterns, and relationships, which is crucial in feature engineering and exploratory data analysis. 
Imblearn : Imblearn provides tools for handling imbalanced datasets, which is common in credit card fraud detection scenarios. 
 
Scikit-learn: This is a comprehensive machine learning library in Python which includes various algorithms for classification, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, etc. 
 
 
TensorFlow or PyTorch: If you're planning to use deep learning models like neural networks, you'll need one of these deep learning frameworks. TensorFlow and PyTorch are the most popular choices for building and training deep learning models. 
 
Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. It provides a simpler interface for building neural networks compared to TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
 
Imbalanced-learn: Imbalanced-learn is a library specifically designed to tackle the problems associated with imbalanced datasets, which are common in credit card fraud detection. It provides various techniques for resampling, such as oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid methods. 
 
Scikit-plot: This library provides easy-to-use functions for plotting common machine learning metrics like confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, etc. 
 
XGBoost or LightGBM: These are gradient boosting libraries which are highly effective for classification tasks. They often perform very well in practice and are worth trying for credit card fraud detection.
